# Detailed Implementation Steps for English Testing Application

## 1. Setup and Configuration

1.1. Set up the development environment

- Install Node.js, npm, and MongoDB
- Initialize a new Node.js project
- Install necessary dependencies (Express, Mongoose, etc.)

  1.2. Configure the database connection

- Set up MongoDB connection in `Backend/config/mongoose.db.js`
- Create environment variables for database URIs

  1.3. Set up project structure

- Create folders for models, routes, controllers, and middleware

## 2. Implement User Management

2.1. Create User model and controller

Libraries to use:

- mongoose: For defining the User schema and model
- bcrypt: For password hashing
- joi: For request validation
- express: For creating the controller and routes

Implementation details:
a. User Model:

- Define the User schema as per the class diagram
- Implement pre-save hook for password hashing
- Add methods for password verification and token generation

b. User Controller:

- Implement user registration logic
  - Validate input using joi
  - Check for existing users with the same email/username
  - Create new user and associated UserProfile
- Implement user login logic
  - Verify credentials
  - Generate and return access and refresh tokens
- Implement password reset functionality
- Create endpoints for updating user information

Example code snippet for user registration:

## 2.2. Implement UserProfile model and controller

- Create endpoints for updating user profile
- Implement methods for tracking user progress

## 2.3. Implement Subscription model and controller

- Create endpoints for managing user subscriptions
- Implement subscription renewal and cancellation logic

## 2.4. Implement authentication middleware

- Libraries to use:

  - jsonwebtoken: For generating and verifying JWTs
  - bcrypt: For password hashing and comparison
  - express-rate-limit: To prevent brute-force attacks

- Implementation details:
  a. Access Token and Refresh Token system:

  - Generate short-lived access tokens (e.g., 15 minutes) and longer-lived refresh tokens (e.g., 7 days)
  - Store refresh tokens in the database with user ID and expiration
  - Implement token rotation: Issue a new refresh token with each use

  b. Multi-device login support:

  - Store multiple refresh tokens per user, each with a unique device identifier
  - Implement a user sessions table in the database to track active sessions across devices

  c. Token-based authentication flow:

  1. User logs in with credentials
  2. Server verifies credentials and generates access and refresh tokens
  3. Tokens are sent to the client (access token in response, refresh token in HTTP-only cookie)
  4. Client includes access token in Authorization header for subsequent requests
  5. When access token expires, client uses refresh token to obtain a new access token
  6. If refresh token is expired, user must log in again

  d. Middleware functions to implement:

  - verifyAccessToken: Check if the access token is valid for protected routes
  - verifyRefreshToken: Validate refresh token and issue new access token
  - revokeRefreshToken: Allow users to log out from a specific device
  - revokeAllRefreshTokens: Allow users to log out from all devices

  e. Security considerations:

  - Implement HTTPS to encrypt all traffic
  - Use secure and SameSite flags for cookies
  - Implement CSRF protection for cookie-based authentication
  - Use rate limiting on login and token refresh endpoints

Example code snippet for access token generation:
