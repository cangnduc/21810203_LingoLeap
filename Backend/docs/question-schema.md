   • Integrate logging and auditing features (e.g., winston for log management)

   7.2 System analytics
   • Use a business intelligence tool like Metabase or Grafana to visualize system data

8. Front-end Development
   8.1 Set up front-end framework
   • Vite for faster builds and development
   • Redux Toolkit: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux for global state management
   • React Router: npm install react-router-dom for navigation

   8.2 Core components and pages
   • Build reusable components (Header, Footer, Forms)
   • Authentication pages: Register, login, dashboard, and user profile

   8.3 State management and data flow
   • Use Redux slices for modular state management (auth, courses, tests, etc.)
   • RTK Query for API interactions and caching: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit query

   8.4 UI and styling
   • Material-UI or Tailwind CSS: npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled for UI
