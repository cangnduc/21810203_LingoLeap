    text: "Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in recent years, transforming various aspects of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced algorithms that power social media feeds, AI is becoming increasingly prevalent. While these advancements bring numerous benefits, they also raise important ethical questions about privacy, job displacement, and the future of human-machine interaction. As AI continues to evolve, it is crucial for society to engage in ongoing discussions about its implications and to establish guidelines for its responsible development and use.",
