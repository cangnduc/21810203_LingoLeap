# Test Selection Page UI Design

## Overall Layout

The test selection page should have a clean, organized layout that helps students easily find and choose the appropriate test. The page will consist of the following main sections:

1. Navigation Bar
2. Page Title and Description
3. Test Difficulty Filter
4. Skill Selection
5. Test List
6. Pagination
7. Footer

## Color Scheme and Typography

We'll use the same color scheme and typography as the home page for consistency.

## Responsive Design

The layout should be fully responsive, following the same breakpoints as the home page.

## Navigation Bar

- Same as the home page, but with "Tests" highlighted to indicate the current page

## Page Title and Description

- Title: "Choose Your Test"
- Brief description explaining the test selection process

## Test Difficulty Filter

- Dropdown or toggle buttons to filter tests by difficulty:
  - All Levels
  - Beginner
  - Intermediate
  - Advanced

## Skill Selection

- Checkboxes or toggle buttons to select skills:
  - All Skills
  - Reading
  - Writing
  - Listening
  - Speaking
- Option to select multiple skills or a single skill

## Test List

- Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- Each test card includes:
  - Test title
  - Difficulty level (with color-coding)
  - Skills covered (icons for reading, writing, listening, speaking)
  - Estimated duration
  - Brief description
  - "Start Test" button

## Pagination

- Page numbers or "Load More" button at the bottom of the test list

## Additional Features

3. Test Preview

   - Modal or expandable section showing more details about a test when clicked
   - Include sample questions or topics covered

7. Adaptive Recommendations

   - Use AI to suggest tests based on the student's learning goals and progress

8. Test Series or Learning Paths

   - Group related tests into series or learning paths for structured progression

9. Timed vs. Untimed Options

   - Allow students to choose between timed tests or practice mode without time limits

10. Collaborative Tests

13. Accessibility Options

14. Progress Tracking

    - Visual representation of completed tests and skills mastered

15. Community Ratings
    - Show average ratings or difficulty assessments from other students who have taken the test

## Responsive Considerations

- Use a list view instead of grid for smaller screens
- Implement collapsible sections for filters and skill selection on mobile

## Performance Optimization

- Implement infinite scrolling or lazy loading for the test list to improve initial load time
- Cache test data for faster browsing and offline access

By implementing these features, the test selection page will provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for students to find and choose tests that match their needs and skill levels. This design encourages engagement with various test types and supports different learning styles and goals.
