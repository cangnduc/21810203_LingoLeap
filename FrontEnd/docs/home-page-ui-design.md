## Additional Responsive Considerations

- Use flexbox or CSS grid for flexible layouts

- Use relative units (em, rem, %) for font sizes and spacing
- Optimize images for different screen sizes using srcset
- Consider using CSS variables for easy theme customization

## Accessibility

- Ensure sufficient color contrast for text readability
- Use semantic HTML elements (header, nav, main, footer, etc.)
- Include proper ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigation functionality

## Performance Optimization

- Lazy load images and videos
- Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallbacks)
- Minimize CSS and JavaScript files
- Implement critical CSS for above-the-fold content

By following this design, the home page will provide a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly experience that effectively showcases the English Testing App's features and benefits.
